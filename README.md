Where every swing meets spring.

Par 2

For centuries in Japan, cherry blossom season (hanami) has been a time for people to come together under the blooming sakura trees to appreciate beauty, reflect on life, and welcome the arrival of spring. It’s a tradition deeply rooted in Japanese culture, symbolizing peace and strength.

At Sakura Meadow, we’ve brought a piece of that experience to you. With glowing cherry blossoms, a torii gate, a light-up mountain inspired by Mt. Fuji, and gentle touches of nature throughout, this course captures the calm and beauty of hanami—without the long flight. Come relax, play, and enjoy the scenery. No passport needed.
